Stupidly-simple python mocking utility with moxie.


Mocksey Motivation
==================

I was teaching a class on unit testing to a group of co-workers who were familiar with `Simple Test for PHP <http://www.simpletest.org/>`_ so I wrote up what is becoming Mocksey in a little bit.

Mocksey the TDD'd version of that TDD utilty. `It's so meta even this acronym <http://xkcd.com/917/>`_.
